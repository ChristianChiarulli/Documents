# Debian which is not supported

Well, this is quiet strange since Ubuntu is derived from Debian (and this last one is more stable).

What are the differences between Debian and Ubuntu that make Debian an unsupported Linux distribution for Xilinx's tools ?

 

BTW it's just required to install libc6-dev-amd64 (*) which install crt1.o crti.o and crtn.o compiled to 64 bit.

Now the command csim_design is executed without any error.

 

(*) If you have libc6-dev-i386 also installed, this could make conflict.
